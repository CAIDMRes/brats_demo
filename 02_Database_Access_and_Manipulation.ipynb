    "MongoDB interactions are mediated primarily through the `cnn.db.Manager()` class. For most the most part, these interactions are abstracted away by higher-level classes that simply use `cnn.db.Manager()` for low-level manipulation. Usually, use of these other more high-level classes (such as `cnn.db.Importer()`) will provide all the database interaction that is necessary. However for debugging or other purposes, access to the `Manager()` class may be useful and thus described here."

Most often times this is sufficient since all images are automatically imported into the `images` collection which typically will be the only collection available in a database (by default). Both the current `db` and `collection` used by the the object will be saved in the `self.loc` dictiontary."
